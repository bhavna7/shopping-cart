3. You can select a row and click on the add to cart button. You’ll also have a view cart button. When you click on the view cart button, you’ll be taken to a different screen where your quantity is a text box where you can change (default value of 1). If you enter a quantity more than the available quantity, it should error.
4. There will also be a buy button on this page. When the buy button is clicked, it will take the user back to the first page and subtract the quantity that they have entered for the item on this page when they show the main grid.
